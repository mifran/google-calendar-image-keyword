# google-calendar-image-keyword
Google Calendar Flairs. Keywords for images/pictures within Google calendar app. This is intended to be a complete list and up-to-date list that can accept contributions from the public.

This is a list of words that trigger background illustrations for the Google Calendar app. Please see [en_us/keywords.md](en_us/keywords.md) for the complete list. If you do not know how to create a pull request to edit the list, please create an issue in the master git repository and describe what you would like added.

You can obtain a preview of the images by replacing the ID with the name of the flair in the following url:

These keywords depend on the language of your browser. Google Calendar recognized only those written in the language in use, not necessarily those in English. It has been translated to the following: UK English, French, German, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Spanish, Arabic, Hebrew, Portuguese, Thai, Russian, Turkish, Dutch, Bulgarian, Greek, Hindi, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Norwegian, Swedish, Slovenian, Ukranian, Slovak, Lithuanian, Latvian, Hungarian, Finnish, Filipino, Farsi, Danish, Czech, Croatian and Catalan. These languages can also be used in the "learnlanguage" flair for things like "English course," "English class," and "Practice English."

See [en_us/keywords.md](en_us/keywords.md) for the US English list.

## June 2025 Android update

Reports from devices running Google Calendar version 2024.37.0-674942318-release
indicate that Google is rolling out a refreshed flair design that removes several
previously supported keywords. Keywords such as `archery`, `ballet`,
`back 2 school`, `billiard`, `boxing`, `car maintenance`, `codecademy`, `coding
time`, `computer science`, `dressage`, `fencing`, `hackathon`, `hour of code`,
`javelin`, `manicure`, `programming in java`, `programming in python`, `rails
girls`, `railsgirls`, `shooting sport`, `shooting sports`, `theatre`, `web
development`, and `web programming` no longer trigger flairs on Android, so
they have been removed from the US English list. The keyword `back2school`
continues to work with the new design.
